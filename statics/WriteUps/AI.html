          2008-style intuition doesn’t transfer to GPU economics. Housing bubbles,

          In 2008, the smartest people in the room were the ones shorting leverage.

        <div class="cq-callout">
          <strong>Thesis:</strong>  
          If you’ve never built or deployed AI systems, your mental model of
          “bubbles” is anchored in the wrong regime. AI is not subprime. AI is
          a compute-driven industrial shift, and traditional macro intuition
          systematically underprices it.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Housing Markets vs Silicon: Two Different Universes</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Housing is slow, physical, and bounded</h3>
        <p>
          The 2008 playbook made sense because housing is easy to model:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Construction takes years, not GPU cycles.</li>
          <li>Supply is geographically constrained and slow to respond.</li>
          <li>Fundamentals are tied to demographics and wages.</li>
          <li>Every input — cement, land, labor — obeys classical economics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Houses don’t become 2× better every 18 months. Your P&amp;L lives in a
          comfortable, linear world.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2 AI is exponential, compute-bound, and physics-limited</h3>
        <p>AI does not live in that world. It lives here:</p>

        <div class="cq-banner">
          <img src="../img/headers/gpu-scaling-banner.jpeg"
               alt="GPU scaling from V100 to H100 and beyond"
               class="cq-banner__img" />
          <div class="cq-banner__body">
            From V100 (2017) to B100/B200 (2025), raw GPU throughput and memory
            bandwidth have leapt forward in discrete, compounding steps. Each
            generation makes more model capacity economically viable.
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          A few rough numbers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>NVIDIA V100 (2017): ~19 TFLOPs</li>
          <li>A100 (2020): ~60 TFLOPs</li>
          <li>H100 (2023): ~197 TFLOPs</li>
          <li>B100/B200 class (2025+): &gt;400 TFLOPs expected</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          At the model level, compute in frontier training runs has grown by
          orders of magnitude in just a few years. Inference cost per million
          tokens has collapsed from double-digit dollars to low cents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Real estate has no equivalent. You can’t update bricks with a firmware patch.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Quant Finance vs AI Engineering — Complexity Gap</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Finance math is elegant, but low-dimensional</h3>
        <p>
          On Wall Street we often treat our own math as exotic. In reality, most of it
          is shockingly tame from an engineering perspective:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Black–Scholes is just a linear PDE, equivalent to the heat equation.
          </li>
          <li>
            A typical option pricer deals with a handful of variables — spot,
            vol, rate, time, maybe skew.
          </li>
          <li>
            Greeks are smooth and well-behaved under small shocks.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That’s not an insult. It’s why hedging works. It’s why we can run
          intraday risk in spreadsheets when we have to.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 AI is nonlinear, emergent, and fragile</h3>
        <p>
          Training and operating modern AI systems is nothing like pricing a
          structured note:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>High-dimensional, non-convex optimization landscapes.</li>
          <li>Models with 10<sup>11</sup>–10<sup>12</sup> parameters.</li>
          <li>Thousands of GPUs synchronized over high-speed networks.</li>
          <li>Failure modes that appear suddenly and non-intuitively.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="cq-quote">
          A mortgage book can blow up slowly. A training run can blow up in
          300 milliseconds when your gradients go to NaN.
        </div>

        <p>
          The mental toolkit you use for mortgages and macro doesn’t translate.
          The AI world is closer to rocket engineering than to credit analysis.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Why Hands-On Experience Matters</h2>

        <p>
          There’s a reason engineers quietly roll their eyes when prominent
          investors declare that “AI is just another bubble.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Most skeptics haven’t:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Written or debugged a CUDA kernel.</li>
          <li>Dealt with a deadlocked distributed training job.</li>
          <li>Optimized memory alignment to squeeze 3% more throughput.</li>
          <li>Re-tuned a learning-rate schedule because the model collapsed mid-run.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Without that pain, you fall back on analogy. And analogy is where
          the big mistakes happen.
        </p>

        <div class="cq-callout">
          <strong>Linus Torvalds Principle:</strong>  
          “Talk is cheap. Show me the code.”  
          In AI, code — and the infrastructure behind it — is the only
          reliable signal.
        </div>

        <h2>4. AI Progress Is Measurable, Not Narrative</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Scaling laws</h3>
        <p>
          AI progress isn’t mystical; it follows scaling laws. Performance
          improves smoothly as you increase:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Compute (FLOPs)</li>
          <li>Parameters</li>
          <li>High-quality data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Unlike market sentiment, these curves are stable and surprisingly
          predictable. Frontier models keep landing where the scaling papers say
          they should.
        </p>

        <h3>4.2 FLOPs per dollar</h3>
        <p>
          In 2012, you might pay roughly a dollar for a gigaflop of meaningful
          AI compute. A decade later, the same dollar buys tens of thousands of
          gigaflops. That’s a 10,000×–50,000× improvement in effective price-performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          No asset class you trade behaves like that.
        </p>

        <h2>5. The “AI = Dot-Com” and “Circular Funding” Fallacies</h2>

        <h3>5.1 AI is not a sector, it’s a substrate</h3>
        <p>
          Saying “AI is like 1999 tech” assumes it’s just another theme you
          can rotate out of. It isn’t. AI is becoming embedded in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Software creation and testing.</li>
          <li>Chip design and verification.</li>
          <li>Healthcare, drug discovery, and genomics.</li>
          <li>Robotics, logistics, and supply chain optimization.</li>
          <li>Finance, insurance, and QIS index design.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You don’t “rotate out of electricity.” You re-price everything that uses it.
        </p>

        <h3>5.2 The “circular funding” meme</h3>
        <p>
          A popular skeptic narrative goes: VCs fund AI startups → startups buy
          GPUs → NVIDIA pumps → everyone pretends this is real.
        </p>
        <p>
          It sounds clever until you look at the mechanics:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            GPUs are industrial input, like lithography tools for TSMC or CRISPR
            machines for biotech.
          </li>
          <li>
            Model outputs are measurable: code quality, reasoning ability,
            latency, token cost, benchmark scores.
          </li>
          <li>
            Demand is external: law firms, hedge funds, manufacturers, schools
            — all paying cash for AI services.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Circular funding schemes die when the music stops. AI gets cheaper
          and more capable every quarter. That’s not a carousel; that’s an
          efficiency curve.
        </p>

        <div class="cq-section-divider"></div>

        <h2>6. Structurer’s View: Where This Matters for Risk and Product Design</h2>

        <h3>6.1 Mispricing the regime shift</h3>
        <p>
          If your CIO or investment committee treats AI as the “next dot-com,”
          your entire product shelf risks underweighting the very thing that
          will reshape spreads, basis, and client flows for the next decade.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a structurer, that translates into:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Under-engineering AI-linked baskets and indices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Overweighting legacy yield products in sectors that will be eaten
            by software.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mis-estimating long-dated correlation between “old economy” and
            “AI-levered” names.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.2 Where the opportunity lives</h3>
        <p>
          From a CoffeeQuant lens, the interesting ideas are not “AI theme”
          brochures, but hard-engineered payoff structures:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>AI-chip dispersion trades</strong> — long convexity on
            winners, short index vol.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AI + gold hybrid notes</strong> — pairing deflationary
            compute with inflation hedges.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>QIS strategies</strong> that tilt toward AI adoption
            factors in sector rotation.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Closing Thought — The Risk of Being “Too Early Bearish”</h2>
        <p>
          In 2008, being cynical paid. In 2025, being blindly cynical about AI
          is starting to look like standing on the tracks explaining why trains
          can’t possibly go that fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          For traders and structurers, the edge isn’t in grand pronouncements.
          It’s in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Understanding the physics and economics of compute.</li>
